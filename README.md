# IoT-Based-Weather-Monitoring-System
           In this project I gathered real time weather data like temperature, humidity, and pressure by using the sensors and displayed it over the web page using a 
Raspberry Pi.
           Also stored these data over the cloud like Thingspeak for monitoring and used for forecasting.
